These nozzles produce rotating streams of water that reduce runoff and save up to 30% more water than traditional spray nozzles. The low precipitation rate allows soil to absorb water slowly, while large droplets resist wind drift. Adjustable arcs and radii make them suitable for a variety of landscapes, and they retrofit easily onto standard spray heads. A removable filter screen and double-pop design protect the nozzle from debris. It features 8 l/hr.",
